This project was a completed assignement due towards the end of the DePaul University Android Software Development program.  

The app is a walking tour for downtown Chicago.  It uses geolocation and google services to track the user's location.
A path tells the user where they should walk to. Geofences notify the user when they are approaching a landmark.
Several toggles allow the user to see more information on the map or declutter when desired.

A separate activity provides details on the landmarks themselves, and can be opened when the user approaches them.
